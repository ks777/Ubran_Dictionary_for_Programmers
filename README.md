# Programing for Pinheads

## Summary
You ever overhear a conversation between two programmers and wonder "I have no idea what they are saying." Well, with this program, we`ve dumbed down the conversation into something much more relatable and understandable. Now you too can enjoy that conversation in the water cooler before promptly getting fired when you boss realized you needed this web appliction to function.
TLDR: Programmer`s Urban Dictionary

## Purpose
Made in HackPrinceton Fall 2017, I wanted to put all I learned the last 4 months into a fun little program, further utilizing database and integrating them into a web application. Users will be able to create new entries and their unique definitions into the program, as it will be saved for later usage. 

## Instructions
Assuming a Command Prompt usage and you have installed the proper packages onto your system:
-Make sure you have MySQL and the given database within your application. Same variables must apply for the program to register and connect to the database.
-To start up this program, you will need to head to the project`s directory.
-run venv/scripts/activate in your command prompt.
-and then run app.py in the command prompt. 
-To access the webpage, go to your internet browser and type Localhost:5000.
-Enjoy

**UPDATE: After a hardware wipe, I`ll be checking at old projects and making sure they work Proper.**
