# Programmer's Urban Dictionary

## Summary
You ever overhear a conversation between two programmers or IT professionals and think: "I have no idea what they are saying." I took this concept and utilized my current focus on python and databases to create an interactable website that converts a text of technical jargon to a more simplified form.

## Purpose
Made in HackPrinceton Fall 2017, I wanted to put all I learned the last 4 months into a fun little program, further utilizing databases and integrating them into a web application. Users will be able to create new entries and their unique definitions into the program, as it will be saved for later usage. 

## Instructions
Assuming a Command Prompt usage and you have installed the proper packages onto your system:

-Make sure you have MySQL and the given database within your application. Same variables must apply for the program to register and connect to the database.

-To start up this program, you will need to head to the project's directory.

-run venv/scripts/activate in your command prompt.

-and then run app.py in the command prompt. 

-To access the webpage, go to your internet browser and type Localhost:5000.

-Enjoy!
